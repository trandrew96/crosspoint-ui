# CrossPoint 🎮

**CrossPoint** is a videogame collection companion — think Letterboxd or IMDb, but for games. Users can discover upcoming and trending releases, track their backlog, write reviews, and organize games into custom shareable lists, all in one place.

> 🔧 This project is currently in **active development**.

## What It Does

CrossPoint gives gamers a dedicated space to manage their relationship with games — not just what they're playing, but what's on their radar, what they've finished, and what they think about it all.

**Key features include:**

- 📅 **Game Discovery** — Browse upcoming releases, recently launched titles, and what's trending
- 📋 **Backlog Tracker** — Add games to your personal backlog and keep your queue organized
- ⭐ **Reviews** — Write and publish reviews for games you've played
- 📁 **Custom Lists** — Curate your own collections (e.g. "Hidden Gems", "Couch Co-op Favorites") and share them publicly or keep them private
- 🔐 **User Accounts** — Secure authentication with personalized profiles
